                    <p>This hardy plant thrives on neglect, making it perfect for beginners. 
                    It prefers bright, indirect light but can tolerate low light. 
                    Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, as overwatering can lead to root rot. 
                    It’s also an excellent air purifier.</p>
